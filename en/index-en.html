  <h2>🎓 About</h2>
  <p>With over 20 years of experience in strategic communication and client relations, I have chosen to reinvent myself in the data field to combine analytical rigor, business acumen, and storytelling clarity.</p>
  <p>This portfolio reflects a committed personal and professional journey: a career transition built around hands-on projects, diverse problematics, and a constant drive to make data understandable, useful, and actionable.</p>
  <p>💡 It gathers the most representative projects of my development in data: e-commerce analysis, customer behavior exploration, dynamic dataviz, statistical testing, and asset modeling.</p>

  <p>These projects, spanning use cases in marketing, logistics, customer satisfaction, and personal finance, demonstrate my versatility, rigor, and ability to harness data to drive strategy. As a professional transitioning into data, I now apply my analytical and strategic skills to support informed decision-making. This portfolio showcases projects completed during an intensive data analysis bootcamp, each highlighting my ability to manipulate, visualize, and interpret data to extract concrete, actionable, business-oriented insights.</p>
  <p>Drawing on a background in communication and strategy, I now combine analytical precision, narrative sense, and data tool mastery to support transformation, optimization, and value-enhancing projects. Enjoy your reading!</p>
