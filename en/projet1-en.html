  <h2>🛠️ Technical Skills Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced SQL (joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, CASE, GROUP BY, HAVING)</li>
    <li>Data exploration and cleaning</li>
    <li>Descriptive analysis and KPI calculations: CLV, AOV, CAC, delivery delays, satisfaction rate</li>
    <li>Presentation of results and strategic recommendations</li>
  </ul>
