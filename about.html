  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>With over 20 years of experience in communication, strategy, and business development, I have supported small and mid-sized companies in growing their activity through practical, human-centered, and results-driven approaches.</p>

  <p>My career transition into <strong>data analytics</strong> came as a natural evolution ‚Äî a way to enhance my business expertise with an analytical mindset, helping organizations turn data into clear, actionable insights.</p>

  <h2>üéØ What drives me:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding real business challenges, identifying performance levers, and making data speak in a clear and impactful way.</li>
    <li>Blending analytical rigor with storytelling, using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Looker Studio to support data-driven decision-making.</li>
    <li>Supporting organizations in their transformation, with a cross-functional approach that connects data, strategy, tools, and communication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîç My positioning:</h2>
  <p>I bring a <strong>hybrid profile</strong> to the table ‚Äî able to bridge the gap between technical teams, marketers, salespeople, and decision-makers. I believe data becomes a true driver of alignment and impact when it is <strong>structured, visualized, and narrated with clarity</strong>.</p>

  <h2>üìä This portfolio:</h2>
  <p>This portfolio reflects my transition through hands-on projects completed during my training, personal initiatives, and a <strong>constant curiosity to make data accessible, strategic, and meaningful</strong>.</p>
